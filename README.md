# Hi, I'm Jennifer (she/her)! ðŸ‘‹
I'm a biomedical engineering undergraduate at the University of Waterloo in Ontario, Canada. I'm currently exploring building powerful computational biology tools and models to draw novel insights into the field of neuroscience. I was previously working at @strandtx, @cembrowskilab, @tdlabio, @uwblueprint, @hackthenorth. Learn more about me at https://jennifertsai.ca/ !
